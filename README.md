Continous Integration
Before going deep into the concepts of Travis CI, let us discuss Continous Integration.
In the era of Waterfall model, you are forced to collect all the requirements at the initial stage and build the project with those requirements (which should be handed over to the client). The disadvantage, in this case, is the client requirements can be changed, and there can be miscommunication between you and the client.
To overcome this, you have changed to Agile model where you will submit 1 or 2 features of the project. (For example, it contains ten projects). You will get continuous feedback from the client.
Let us consider an example that you are developing a project. You need to develop ten modules, and each module is developed by a different developer.
After developing the modules, you will perform a unit testing. If it works fine and you need to integrate your module with other modules and perform integration testing.
Instead of performing a week or a month integration testing, you will write code, commit it, build and automatically test. This is known as Continous integration.
