Travis CI Introduction
What is the function of Travis CI?

The code that you have developed will be automatically built, tested and immediately sent to you with the feedback whether your build is successful or not.
Travis CI will clone your repository from the GitHub into a new virtual environment, and it performs different tasks to build and test your code.
If any one of the tasks fails, then the build will be broken, or if all the tasks are passed then, Travis CI will deploy your code to the server or application.
